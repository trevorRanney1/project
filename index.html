    <h1>Everything to Know About my Personal Project</h1>
    <h4>By: Trevor Furtado</h4>

    <p>I chose to make a website about my personal project for obvious reasons. This is something I've created and thus something that I have a lot of passion and will to share things about. My personal project is basically right now me prototyping an RPG that I want to make where you can choose three characters at a time for battles. Each character has a different set of states and moves based off of them so teams can be more strategic and creative or more brute-force based. I really want this game to have a sort of cartoonish or charming personality and feeling to it. Even though I want to make the battle system complex, I also want to put a lot of time into making the game just enjoyable to experience overall. Also, something to note is that I set my bar high for what I want this game to be. I may have no coding knowledge now but this is like the big thing I wanna be able to create using Computer Science.</p>
