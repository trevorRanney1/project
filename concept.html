    <h1>Concept Art</h1>

    <p>I've made a decent amount of concept art for this game because a few thing that I've had to make would be a whole lot more difficult to create without a plan ahead of time. Some art shown here will also be scrapped pixel art.</p>

He was telling me I should make some sort of big Glorp character to fight and I told him I actually wanted to do that. The only issue is it just wouldn't look right. He then sent me this picture to put what he was thinking out onto paper and the design stuck ever since.</td>

          <td>This was my original concept for the final boss of the game. I still made this into a sprite but when I showed it to the now recurring person Joel, he just said that it didn't work because the character didn't feel relevent to the rest of the game and that there should be a sort of twist final boss afterwards.</td>

          <td class = "tabletext">Mutant Larry</td>
          <td>This final piece of concept art is what I actually made after Joel's critisism. Larry is a character on your team for the whole game, but when he falls into a barrel of nuclear waste he transforms into this monstrosity. In this concept art I also added the character CoolGuy11 at the bottom as he was a character whow anted to join the party for the entire game. Once Larry's gone he has full reign to take his spot in battle.</td>
