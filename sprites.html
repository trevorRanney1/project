    <h1>Sprites</h1>

    <p>This page on my website is here to showcase some of my proudest sprites that I've made on my Personal Project. A fun fact about the sprites I've made is that I can guarantee that every single asset aside from maybe some concept art used in this website including the font was created entirely by me using Paint.Net.</p>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">???</td>
          <td>I haven't decided on a name for this sprite yet, but it's based off of an old character that I drew a long time ago and I'm pretty happy with the shading on it. It's a very simple sprite but I'm happy with how it turned out.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/thing.png" alt = "Sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">Gacha Destroyer</td>
          <td>The Gacha destoyer is a sprite I'm proud of for it's expression and hat mainly. It turned out basically exactly as I wanted it. I feel I was able to show the cartoonishly angry expression and police hat relatively well in a small space using pixel art.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/gd.png" alt = "The Gacha Destroyer"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">???</td>
          <td>This one I also have not come up with a name with, I really like how the shading on the face turned out going from a yelowish glow to a dark green. I also like the way the leaves ended up looking.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/leaf.png" alt = "Sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">Sumo Toad</td>
          <td>I honestly don't know how I came up for the concept for this sprite but I ended up really happy with the result. This is my favorite 32x32 sprite and maybe my favorite sprite I've made. It may not be the sprite I'm most proud of but I think it has my favorite overall design and color scheme.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/toad.png" alt = "Sumo Toad"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">King Paul</td>
          <td>King Paul is one of my favorite characters and sprites that I've created. The original sprite for him was meant to look sort of rushed and was based off of a drawing my friend made. Even though I purposefully made the sprite look rushed or unfinished I still love the result. I feel proud of this sprite because in the newer version I added his throne. The throne itself took about an hour to get right and seeing the finished product is just really satisfying. It's still not the best sprite I've made and nor is the throne but I love it regardless.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/paul.png" alt = "King Paul"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">???</td>
          <td>This is another character with no name. This was honestly a really easy sprite to make but I really like how it turned out. I don't have too much else to say here. Also, the red stuff is ketchup, this isn't even a joke I plan to say this within the game.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/creature.png" alt = "Sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">Ed</td>
          <td>For a long time I've had this villian character named Ed. He was made up by Nadeem and I and this sprite is basically a really strong version of him. He was never meant to be a very manacing villian but I would run away from someone that looked like this.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/ed.png" alt = "Ed"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">???</td>
          <td>Another sprite with no name, but I know the concept for it. Basically a mad scientist character transports his conciousness into a car to try and defeat the player using machinary. This sprite didn't come out exactly how I wanted it to but I still think it ended up looking really good.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/car.png" alt = "Sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">Krunk Bot</td>
          <td>This was originally just this tiny robot build that I made in Minecraft. I grew so attached to the character that I kept going with it and now I plan to put it in a game. I like this sprite a lot because of the sort of 3D prespective of it. I also really like the tank-like wheels.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/krunk.png" alt = "Krunk Bot"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class = "tabletext">Fuzangyawn</td>
          <td>This is the sprite that I'm the most proud of. Funnily enough he's kind of another idea by my friend. He told me that I should create an enemy based on a dragon called "Fuzanglong" I decided to play a joke on that name and create a tired and lazy dragon called Fuzangyawn. When you first find him you would only see his head sticking out of the entrance to a cave. Later on you would get the full reveal of him when he has to gain the mild strength to get up. I am really happy with this sprite. I struggled with it for a really long time. His full body was made months after his head because I never wanted to start it. Now that it's finished though, I am incredibly happy with it. It stands as the sprite I feel the most proud of out of all of the sprites I've made.</td>
          <td class = "img"><img class = "tableimg" src = "images/fuzangyawn.png" alt = "Fuzangyawn"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>

    <p>There are some more recent sprites that I've made in between making this website that I also feel very proud of but I wouldn't know where to list. These sprites will be listed here in an unordered list.</p>
