    <h1>The Battle System</h1>

    <p>Battles in this game are planned to be sort of a mix between games like Deltarune and the Mario and Luigi Series. The idea is: you select three of eight characters to be in your party. All of these characters have varying stats. I also wanna add a secret unlockable character.</p>

    <h4>The Steps of a Battle</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>When a battle starts, your three of eight chosen characters will take turns in the order that you set them.</li>
      <li>Once you've chosen what all three characters will do they will attack and then each enemy turn one character will go out to dodge enemy attacks in chronological order.</li>
      <li>While dodging, some character will have abilities unique to them like how some party members may be able to dodge, block, or dash.</li>
      <li>When all enemies are defeated the three chosen characters will gain the appropriate amount of exp based on what enemies were fought.</li>
      <li>On rare occasions, bossfight may work differently, I haven't fully planned things out but I'd like one fight to have a 3D moving background at a low pixelated resolution where you walk around a volcano dodging attacks. There's also another fight that would have the players facing up at the boss looming over them as opposed to a more side-based view.</li>
    </ol>
